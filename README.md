# transpos
Fun project for transposition cipher. I created it for practice with memory management in C.

You can use simple `Makefile` to build project with gcc. 

## Usage
 - Enter `E/e` for encrypt message stored in file named `plaintext`.

 - Enter `D/d` for decrypt message stored in file named `cipher`.

 - Enter `Q/q` or `Ctrl-C` to quit.

### TODO
 - Read message from stdin or specified file
 - Write message to specified file
 - Add frequency analyzer
 - Try to solve problem with plaintext/key stored in memory after exit
